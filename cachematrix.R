## This creates helper functions to wrap a matrix and cache the inverse

## Creates helper functions around a given matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
}


## Checks the cache for the inverse, and calculates it if not found

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
}
